# Daily-Work-Calendar

## Description

In this project our class was tasked with building on starter code for a daily calendar in order to meet a certain set of criteria. Our goal was to create an application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the standard work day. The application runs in a browswer and utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. We also utilized functions from Day.js.

## Screenshot of Application:
